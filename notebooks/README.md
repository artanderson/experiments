# Notebooks

This area is for [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) in .ipynb format. Python and Java notebooks are currently supported by the kernel.

The list of notebooks below has links to browse each notebook in the viewer and to launch it in interactive mode in Binder. This repository also provides a Docker container that you can install (see the [instructions](../README.md)) to run the notebooks locally.
