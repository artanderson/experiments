For example, tools like aql or asadm that take arguments do not work, for example: ‘aql -c “select * from test.demo”’. Actions such as changing the server config or tailing server log may not be possible through the Java kernel’s %sh escape.\n",

    "1. Use a terminal window. If you have access to a directory view in the notebook (in an installed container setting, and if Binder is launched on a directory), there is a New menu on the top right side. Select New->Terminal for a fully functional shell.\n",
    "2. Use Python kernel’s shell magic. \n",
    "    - In a new notebook. If the directory view is not accessible (this is the case when the notebook is directly launched in Binder), start a new Python notebook and use the “!!” cell magic or “!” line magic to access shell commands The Python kernel’s shell access im better than Java kernel’s at this point.\n",
    "    - In the same notebook. A somewhat kludgy way is to access Python kernel’s bash shell magic from the same (Java) notebook by changing the notebook kernel to Python. You can then use Python kernel’s shell magic (!! or !) to view logs, change server config, and so on. However when you get back to the Java kernel to run your Java cells, the old state is lost, and you will need to re-execute necessary cells."
